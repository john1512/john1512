					<p>News articles appear on the Home page as well as the News page.  The Home page shows the 2 most recently-created articles, and the text of each article is truncated for brevity.</p>
					<p>To create a new News article that will appear on both the News page as well as the Home page:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Log into the admin area of the website at <a href="http://john1512ministries.org/refinery/" target="_blank">http://john1512ministries.org/refinery/</a></li>

						<li>Enter the Title of the article, and supply a publish date.</li>
						<li>Next, you need to supply the body of the article itself.

Note that if you choose to type from scratch, you should use a web browser like Firefox that has automatic spell check enabled so that you're alerted as you type of any spelling mistakes.</li>
						<li>IMPORTANT: After you finish entering your news article, click but Save button in the lower left.  Note that you may still return to the article to edit it, or you may delete the article altogether.</li>

					<h2><a name="inquiries">Managing INQUIRIES</a></h2>
					
					<p>When a user clicks the 'Contact' link in the main navigation, completes the form and clicks the 'Send message' button, an email is sent to John 15:12, and the message is recorded in the admin area of the website.  In addition, the user who completed the form will receive a confirmation email thanking them for the inquiry.</p>
					<p>Inside the admin area, the Inquiries tab displays a listing of all submissions made via the Contact form.  The small icons repeated with each item in the list allow you to: mark an item as spam, read the full text of the inquiry, and delete the inquiry (the deletion is permanent).
					The buttons on the far right are 'Spam' (view any messages marked as spam), 'Update who gets notified' (update the email address used when a user sends you a message via the 'Contact' link on the site) and 'Edit confirmation email' (allows you to customize the Subject and Body text of the confirmation email received by users who copmlete the Contact form).
